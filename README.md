# hello-world
Just another repository. 

My name is Warren.  I'm 42 years old and I'm picking up where I left off in the field of Computer Science.  I'm trying to dedicate myself to learning Computer Science with the philosophy of "No Zero Days (NZD)".  NZD means that I MUST learn at least one new thing every single day.  Ideally I will have learned several things though.  This is my attempt to make a change in my life.  Wish me good luck if you happen to read this. ;)
